# PCA-based-Eigenface-Generation
This project goal is to perform the PCA(principal components analysis) on human face images to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving the higher variations in the data. The detailed description is explained in https://github.com/jay1204/PCA-based-Eigenface-Generation/blob/master/PCA%20procedure.pdf
